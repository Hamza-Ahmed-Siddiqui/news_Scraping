    "data": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court of Pakistan Tuesday resumed hearing the case of the Punjab chief minister's election  where Hamza Shahbaz defeated Pervez Elahi  for the third day.During the hearing, Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari's lawyer Irfan Qadir and PPP lawyer Farooq H Naek told the court that they will not be participating in the hearing as a boycott is being observed.Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial then extended an open invitation to all the parties to assist the court in reaching a fair and just decision in the high-profile case.Elahi, who had been defeated on July 22 after 10 PML-Q votes were rejected by Deputy Speaker Punjab Assembly Dost Mazari, had challenged the ruling in the SC.The SC formed a three-member bench to hear the case, but the coalition government objected to it and demanded a full court take up the matter.However, after hearing arguments from all sides for nearly eight hours on Monday, the SC decided not to form a full court bench, saying that the same bench would hear the case.As the SC decided not to form a full bench, the ruling coalition and the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) decided to boycott the apex court's hearing.Qadir told the bench that his client had told him to not be a part of the proceedings as a country-wide boycott of the judiciary is being observed.Qadir told the SC that he would challenge the apex court's decision relating to the full court  wherein the top court decided to not form a full bench to hear the case.Following Qadir, PPP lawyer Farooq H Naek came to the rostrum and informed the CJP that he would not be part of the proceedings.At this, the CJP told him that he is not a party in the case.The CJP said that no legal grounds were presented before the court; arguments were presented only regarding the party head's directions; the court arrived at the conclusion that in the current case, there was no need for a full bench.I will change my opinion only when concrete reasons are given.CJP Bandial said the real question was who could give directions to party lawmakers. The constitution clearly states that the parliamentary party will give directions to MPs, he said.There is no need for further arguments in this case. We will give priority to wrapping up this case as soon as possible, he said.CJP Bandial said that forming a full court was tantamount to unnecessary delay.The formation of a full court and then hearing of the case could have been delayed till September as leaves are being taken in the court.Meanwhile, the top court sought assistance on the matter relating to directions by the party head or a parliamentary party.Assist the court over the legal questions or we will set ourselves aside from the bench, CJP Bandial told Barrister Ali Zafar, the counsel of Elahi.People sitting on my right side have unanimously decided to boycott the proceedings of the court, he said, adding that thankfully, they have enough grace to sit in court to hear the proceedings.Giving his arguments in the case, Zafar said that the petitions against the 21st Amendment were dismissed by a ratio of 13:4 in a full court.However, many judges gave different reasons for dismissing the petitions, he added.Zafar told the court that the constitution mentions that the parliamentary party will give directions to the lawmakers about voting.At this, the CJP questioned whether the party head and parliamentary party were two separate entities.Zafar said that they were two separate entities.CJP Bandial said that the parliamentary party does not may its decision on its own. In light of the political partys directions, the parliamentary party makes its decision.Justice Ahsan then said, according to the constitution, the party head follows the parliamentary party's directions. The CJP said that the parliamentary party does not make a decision unilaterally.The parliamentary party is informed about the party's decision, and based on that, it takes a decision.During the proceedings, Justice Ahsan questioned: Where has the word parliamentary leader been used?The PML-Q counsel replied that the world parliamentary party is used in the Political Parties Order 2002.At this, Justice Ahsan remarked that the word parliamentary leader instead of parliamentary party is just a mistake.Additional Attorney-General (AAG) Amir Rehman then came to the rostrum and said he wanted to present a few suggestions before the court.Has the federal government decided to separate itself from the coalition government? the CJP asked.The AAG told the top judge that he will assist the court under Article 27.At this, the CJP extended an open invitation to assist the court to reach a fair and just decision in the high-profile case.The court then went on a break for an hour and said that the hearing will resume at 2:30pm.While addressing PPP lawyer Naek  who is not participating in the case due to the boycott  Justice Ahsan asked him to give his arguments if some betterment can be made in the case.The issue is, in these cases were are bound by party policy. Although, I was ready to assist the court, he told Justice Ahsan.Minutes before the proceedings of the case started, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry said the government preferred to run away from the case as it does not have arguments to support its claim.Criticising the ruling coalition, the PTI leader said: The government does not recognise the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Hailing the SC decision on the demand for a full court bench in the Punjab CM election case, the PTI leader said: Such cases are heard only by senior judges across the world.Following the Punjab by-election results, Hamza should have tendered his resignation as Punjab CM, he said, adding that they should have corrected their mistakes and the political leadership in the province.The ex-information minister said that democracy thrives when a person who has lost accepts their defeat, slamming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) for its unacceptable attitude towards the SC.Dozens of times, bar associations have condemned such acts [...] the PDM should accept the people's decisions. This case shouldn't have come here; don't place political burden on the SC, he said.Fawad called for the judiciary to be given the freedom to function independently and highlighted that the CJP cannot be dictated.More to follow..."

    "data": " KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee continued Tuesday to lose ground against the US dollar and hit a new low during intraday trade in the interbank market, keeping the financial market jittery amid an ongoing political crisis.The local unit is trading in the interbank market at 233, up from 229.88 a day earlier.The rupee has been one of the worlds worst-performing currencies, slumping 30.2% since the start of the year (2022), The News reported.Tahir Abbas, the head of research at Arif Habib Limited, said: Shortage of dollars, political and economic uncertainty tagged with ambiguity regarding commitment from friendly countries, which is needed for disbursement of IMF tranche were the reasons behind rupees persistent slide.Fears have risen about Pakistan's stuttering economy as its currency fell nearly 8% against the US dollar in the last trading week, while the country's forex reserves stand below $10 billion with inflation at the highest in more than a decade.Alpha Beta Core CEO Khurram Schezad told Geo.tv that the dollar is getting stronger in the global market almost against all the world currencies  and the rupee is not an exception.In addition, he said, Pakistan's external account issues are not settled as yet though imports are slowing.He noted that although the International Monetary Fund is on board for disbursement, the flows are yet to materialise as the Executive Board's final approval is awaited.Global rating agencies have put a negative outlook on the economy, so that is an additional burden that is weighing in on the financial markets in general and forex market in particular, he added.Muhammad Saad Ali, a capital market expert, told Geo.tv that the rise in political uncertainty  of whether the present government will remain in office long enough to stabilise the economy and the continued confusion around who governs the Punjab province  is causing the rupee to slip.Note that balance of payments pressure on the currency have eased, as per the central bank, which asserts that Pakistan has enough capital commitments for the next 12 months to take care of its dollar outflows, he said.I reiterate political uncertainty is weakening market sentiment and leading to more rupee depreciation, Ali added."

    "data": "Senior most Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Qazi Faez Isa has written a letter to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), seeking postponement of its meeting scheduled on July 28, 2022, for the appointment of Sindh and Lahore high courts judges to the apex court, a matter that requires utmost care and due deliberation as it is a matter of extreme delicacy.The justice has severely criticised Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial for scheduling the meeting at such a time when he (Isa) is not able to physically attend the meeting as he is currently on leave abroad.He stated in the letter that while on annual leave, he received a WhatsApp message from the Additional Registrar of the Supreme Court that the CJ has called a meeting of the JCP on July 28 to consider appointing five judges to the SC. No meeting of the JCP was scheduled before I applied for the annual leave but as soon as I left Pakistan the CJ decided to hold two meetings of the JCP to consider appointments to the Sindh and Lahore High Courts, and now a third unscheduled meeting of the JCP is to be held during the summer vacations of the SC, Isa wrote.He said that the summer vacations of the SC were notified by the CJ himself and later gazetted in the Official Gazette. He said that if the CJ renders his own notification utterly meaningless then let him first withdraw it, instead of violating it.Moreover, he mentioned that he was referred to 2,347 pages of documents regarding the appointment of judges through WhatsApp. The CJ wants to rush through a most delicate matter in a very questionable manner. He wants 2,347 pages of documents to be examined in a week.He complained that he was unable to view all the pages as he could access and read only 14 out of 2,347 pages.[...] the documents have still not been couriered to me or sent to the Pakistan Embassy at Madrid for onward transmission to me, he said.Addressing the chief justice he said: CJ please do not ridicule the JCP and your nominees by contravening the Constitution. The JCP deserves to be treated with respect and consideration by its Chairman.Therefore, I request that the JCP meeting should be postponed. Instead, let us first meet to consider how to proceed further in the matter. And, if Chief Justice and senior puisne judges of the high courts are to be bypassed then to first develop for consideration of the JCP criteria for nominees, since the then senior most judge failed to accomplish the task assigned to him, Justice Isa wrote.He also demanded an end to the practice of giving the JCP pre-selected names to consider for the judges' appointments.Restricting the JCP to consider only the CJ's pre-selected nominees is inappropriate. The JCP deserves to be treated with respect and consideration by its Chairman, Justice Isa said.Justice Isa had raised objections to the calling of two Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) meetings for the appointment of new judges in his absence earlier as well.It seems that more care in the appointment of a cook is exercised than in the appointment of judges, the justice said in a WhatsApp message to Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, which was also addressed to the members of the council.Justice Isa said he learnt, through the media that two meetings of the JCP have been called on June 28 and 29, respectively, to consider the nominees."

The top court, however, considered our demand impartially and rejected our petition.Speaking on the occasion, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and PPP Co-Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that when a decision is being taken about an institution, the entire bench should hear the case.Bilawal, while endorsing Fazls statement, said that the PPP, along with all other alliance parties of the PDM, has decided to boycott the court proceedings.PML-N's senior leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that this was the test of the Supreme Court now. He further added that the PDM had warned if the decision was taken by a full court, only then it would be accepted by the people of Pakistan.Abbasi went on to say that the three judges of the existing bench had the responsibility to decide whether or not history would accept their conduct.It should be noted that adjourning the hearing till 11:30 am tomorrow, the court announced that a three-member bench  headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, and comprising Justice Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar  will hear the petition filed by the PML-Q and PTI regarding Hamza Shahbaz being elected as the chief minister of Punjab.The press conference followed a huddle of the government leaders at the Prime Minister's House after the verdict was announced.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Fazl, and Bilawal were among the senior political leaders and government figures in attendance.Leaders of the MQM-P, members of ANP, BAP, BNP and other government-allied parties were also present at the huddle, along with other senior PML-N figures.Earlier, taking to her Twitter account in reaction to the SC's verdict, PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz stated that there was only one reason for not forming a full court  fear.Fear of the contradiction of its own decision, PML-N stalwart wrote.Saying that she was almost sure that a full court will not be formed, Maryam added that when decisions arent taken in accordance with the Constitution, law, and justice, then the formation of a full court is deemed dangerous."

    "data": "KARACHI: Four people, including a father-daughter duo, were electrocuted, while four others drowned due to urban flooding in Karachi on Monday as heavy rains continue to pound the city.One of the tragic incidents took place at a residential apartments' premises on Al-Falah Road in Lyari's Bihar Colony area when a man and his daughter were electrocuted. The rescue teams rushed to the site of the incident and shifted the victims to Civil Hospital, where they were pronounced dead.The deceased were identified as Rehman Usman, 35, and 10-year-old Hifza.Quoting initial reports, police said the incident occurred when Hifza suffered shocks from an electric board in the flat and her father was electrocuted as well as he attempted to save her, The News reported.In another incident in Lyari, an elderly man identified as 60-year-old Salamat Rakha died of electrocution within the limits of the Kalakot police station.

The search operation was halted due to darkness and it will resume today (Tuesday).A six-year-old boy, Ahmed Ali, son of Hassan, drowned in a pond in the Surjani Town area. Rescue workers retrieved the body and transported it to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

She was a resident of the same area.Separately, a teenage boy identified as 17-year-old Bilal, son of Ataur Rehman, drowned in the rainwater in the Clifton area. The body was shifted to the Civil Hospital, Karachi. The deceased teenager was a resident of Keamari.Followed by heavy rain on Sunday in Karachi, more showers on Monday once again wreaked havoc on different parts of the city, incurring losses worth millions of rupees to business owners and ordinary citizens.DHA and Clifton were as usual flooded by rainwater. Khayaban-e-Bukhari, Khayaban-e-Ittehad, Khayaban-e-Nishat, Khayaban-e-Rahat, Khayaban-e-Shujaat, Khayaban-e-Shahbaz and parts of Saba Avenue were completely submerged. In a few DHA phases, rainwater entered peoples homes.Many DHA areas experienced massive power outages as well.We cant go out to get petrol for the generator. Even the gas cylinders are empty now. Living in Karachis posh area is like living in a jungle with no civic amenities at all, said a resident Sidra Qureshi.The heavy rain caused immense hardships for patients and other people who had to step out of their homes despite the announcement of a public holiday on Monday.Amid criticism following the devastating situation in Karachi after the first spell of monsoon downpour, even though the city had received less rain than last year, the city administration acted swiftly this time round, using more manpower and deploying more resources to clear the key road links after hours-long efforts.II Chundrigar Road, Saddar, old city areas, Zainab Market, Lyari and the adjoining areas were completely flooded. After rainwater receded from the Urdu Bazaar, the rubbish and sludge made it impossible for anyone to enter the streets.Jahangir Road, which has been under construction since ages, was completely inundated with sewage-mixed rainwater. The Malir River flooded with rainwater and subsequently, the Korangi Crossing was once again closed for traffic. The adjoining Qayyumabad was also partially blocked, causing a disruption in traffic movement for hours.The Malir Bridge that connects Quaidabad to the Malir 15 area was also partially broken after potholes developed in it, causing a traffic jam for hours.Nagan Chowrangi, Saleem Centre, Power House Chowrangi, Shadman Town, Sakhi Hassan, Five Star and KDA Chowrangi were also flooded. Even after rainwater was drained, the roads were marred by huge ditches. The 4K roundabout area turned into a river with more than knee-deep water, rendering it completely inaccessible for any kind of vehicle.A flood-like situation was witnessed in Surjani Town. After rainwater entered Yusuf Goth and Bismillah Town, law enforcement agencies with the help of the district administration rescued its residents.Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab visited the stormwater drains in the Shaheen Complex and provincial assembly area. He said the nullahs were still flowing at full capacity.He kept posting updates on social media about relief and drainage operations. According to him, major roads like Sharea Faisal, MA Jinnah Road, University Road, Shershah Suri Road, Shahrah-e-Pakistan, Rashid Minhas Road, Garden Road, Gizri Road and Hub River Road were cleared by afternoon.Meanwhile, a senior Karachi Water & Sewerage Board official admitted that the situation in the city would take time to normalise.Rainwater is almost drained out from all major roads but its the overflowed sewerage lines in residential areas that have become a challenge, for which we have deployed more resources and hired temporary staff.Many areas were deprived of electricity as soon as rain started. Until the filing of this report, power was yet to be restored to some parts of Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Malir, Landhi and Korangi.The K-Electric spokesperson said that during the break from rain, power is swiftly being restored.Power supply to the city continues to remain stable, and approximately 60 feeders out of 1,900 have been powered down mostly for safety reasons.The spokesperson said that due to waterlogging and illegal connections, some areas may remain powered down as a safety precaution, but as clearance is received, power restoration will be underway.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that many areas of Karachi received very intense rain in the early hours, and it continued for several hours, while in some areas over 100mm of rain was recorded during the spell that caused rainwater to accumulate on main arteries in almost all the districts.Sindh Chief Meteorological Officer Dr Sardar Sarfaraz said that the heaviest spell of the current monsoon system was observed in Mondays early hours, as hours-long showers were caused by the strong cells that had formed over Karachi coupled with the Arabian Seas support.Dr Sarfaraz said that the latest data indicate that Karachi may continue to receive moderate rain with some heavy falls on Tuesday, adding that intermittent rain and showers are also possible on Wednesday because the monsoon system is getting strength from the Arabian Sea.According to PMD data, PAF Base Masroor received the highest amount of rain (204mm) over the past 24 hours, followed by Keamari (188.5mm), Saddar (164mm), Surjani Town (157.3mm), Gulshan-e-Hadeed (154mm), DHA Phase-II (126mm), Quaidabad (111.4mm), Orangi Town (108.5mm), Nazimabad (106mm), Gadap Town (103.6mm), North Karachi (99mm), PAF Base Faisal (88.5mm), Saadi Town (85.1mm), Gulshan-e-Maymar (81.8mm), Old Terminal (81.7mm), University Road (81mm), Korangi (75.7mm) and Jinnah Terminal (65.2mm).Sindh Chief Secretary Dr Muhammad Sohail Rajput said on Monday that shanty dwellings built on storm water drains in old areas of Karachi are the main cause of urban flooding in these neighbourhoods. Visiting different areas, he said the provincial government will sort out the chronic drainage issue.Rajput visited MA Jinnah Road, Shaheen Complex, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Garden, Lyari, Five Star Chowrangi, KDA Chowrangi, Sharea Faisal, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Tariq Road, Lyari Expressway, Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi and other localities to inspect the drainage situation. During his visit, the CS was briefed by the deputy commissioners of the East and West districts, and the officials of the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board about rainwater drainage in different areas."

    "data": "After three years of repeated attempts to get her digital national identity card, Rubina - a woman from the Pakistani city of Karachi - decided to take her battle to court, winning a landmark victory.Until then, Pakistanis had not been able to get the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) unless they presented their father's ID card - an impossibility for many people, including those like Rubina who were raised by single mothers.The card is vital to vote, access government benefits including public schools and healthcare, open a bank account or apply for jobs.I would turn up there, and be told to bring my father's card, said Rubina, 21.My mother raised me after my father abandoned us soon after my birth - how could I furnish his identity papers then?Rubina's frustration drove her to file a petition at the high court in Sindh province, which in November ruled that the government agency that oversees the CNIC must issue her a card based on her mother's citizenship record.For Rubina, the decision meant she could apply to take over her mother's job as an attendant in the state education department when her mother retired.More widely, her case ends the effective exclusion of children of single mothers from the ID card scheme, said Haris Khaleeq, secretary-general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), a nonprofit.Without a CNIC, neither can any public service be accessed, nor can any banking transaction be conducted, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.In short, one has no rights at all as a citizen.The agency in charge of the CNIC, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), has said it is striving to reach people who have so far been excluded.The government has a clear policy that people who are supposed to be registered in the database will not be excluded, said Salman Sufi, head of the prime minister's Strategic Reforms Unit, which oversees the implementation of federal policy.Established in 2000, NADRA maintains the nation's biometric database, and says it has issued some 120 million CNICs to 96% of adults in the nation of about 212 million people.Each card comprises a 13-digit unique ID, a photograph of the person, their signature, and a microchip that contains their iris scans and fingerprints.Yet millions of people in Pakistan, including women, transgender people, migrant workers and nomadic communities are still without a CNIC.More than 1 billion people globally have no way of proving their identity, according to the World Bank.While governments across the world are adopting digital ID systems they say are improving governance, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights has said they exclude marginalised groups, and should not be a prerequisite for accessing social protection schemes.A study of migrant workers in Karachi by HRCP last year showed that women were more likely not to have a CNIC, putting them at risk of destitution if their husband died or left the family.Children whose parents are not registered are especially vulnerable, as they cannot get birth certificates, and are at greater risk of trafficking and forced labour, HRCP said.It has recommended more mobile registration units and female staff to help register vulnerable groups, as well as simpler processes and less stringent documentation requirements, which also make it harder for immigrants to apply.Only half of some 2.8 million Afghan refugees who have lived in Pakistan for decades are registered with the government. There is also a sizable population of unregistered Bengali, Nepali, and Rohingya immigrants in Pakistan.A majority of the Bengali-origin Pakistanis do not have CNICs and are living like aliens and illegal migrants in their own country, Sheikh Feroz, a community leader, told a recent rally to demand CNICs.NADRA - which has also helped set up digital ID systems in Bangladesh, Kenya and Nigeria - has said it has a dedicated registration department especially for women, minorities, transgender and unregistered persons.The agency said it had several women-only centres, particularly in border provinces, to overcome the socio-cultural barriers of women hesitating to deal with male staff, and prioritises senior citizens and the disabled.Everyone will be provided an opportunity to get registered. No group based on their ethnicity, race or religion will be excluded, said Sufi, from the Strategic Reforms Unit.For those who have a CNIC, privacy violations are a risk.The CNIC database is accessed by about 300 public and private service providers, from the tax department to the election commission to mobile service providers.There have been several data breaches, which points to inadequate security, said Nighat Dad, a lawyer and executive director at the Digital Rights Foundation, a nonprofit.Women often complain of harassment after their personal information is leaked and is weaponised to blackmail them, she said.Since there is no data protection law, there is no accountability even when personal data such as phone numbers are leaked, she added.Data breaches that expose personal data are particularly risky for vulnerable groups such as journalists, activists and religious and ethnic minorities, said Haroon Baloch, senior programme manager at Bytes for All, a digital rights group.Citizens are not aware of the use of their biometric data, he said. The personal data attached with the biometric IDs can be misused, with serious privacy implications not just for the individual, but also their family.NADRA officials have rejected accusations that the data has been compromised, saying the database has a multi-layer security system which makes hacking impossible.The government will roll out a data privacy policy very soon, said Sufi, with adequate safeguards for data protection, and punishment in case of breach of privacy or data theft.For Rubina, who could not even get a COVID-19 vaccine without a CNIC, simply getting the ID is half the battle won.I am happy that others will not suffer like me, she said."

    "data": "Pakistan hasobtained total foreign loans of $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2021-22, including highly expensive $2.24 billion commercial loans just last month (June 2022) to avoid rapid depletion of foreign currency reserves.Due to the government's inability to restart the IMF programme, Islamabad was unable to obtain budgetary/policy loans from multilateral creditors and had to rely on loan disbursements for project financing. In such a case, the government would have to rely on commercial loans, bilateral deposits, the issuance of international bonds, and guaranteed loans to bridge the financing gaps.However, the external debt repayments and increased imports bill resulted in depleting of foreign currency reserves and the foreign exchange reserves declined from $20 billion to below $10 billion till June 30, 2022.

    "data": "Following the ruling coalition's decision to boycott Supreme Courts hearing on the Punjab chief minister's election after the apex court rejected the plea to form a full bench, PTI reacted strongly and berated the ruling alliance for its decision, Geo News reported.Earlier, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said if the SC doesnt form a full court, we [PDM] will also reject all decisions of the judiciary as we will not appear before this three-member bench.We boycott the proceedings of the apex court, Fazl announced, adding that the coalition government doesn't want any institution to interfere in its matters. During a late-night press conference, PTI Vice President Shah Mahmood Qureshi called it an attack on the judiciary by the executive.Today, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) has attacked the constitution, however, the nation will reject those who have rejected the SCs decision, he said.Qureshi said that sweets were distributed in the country when SC had announced its verdicts in their favour, but now they (PDM) have turned against judges.According to The News, Qureshi said his party was ready to sit with the government if there was an agenda and the only way out of the present vortex was to hold free and transparent elections.We can discuss with them how to hold transparent elections and how to restore the credibility of the Election Commission and what reforms are needed. We have no personal enmity with anyone, he maintained.PTI Secretary General Asad Umar went on to say that the judiciary has been given threats as they (the ruling coalition) are in a state of shock after the court rejected their fake demands.Same three judges were a part of the bench who had given decision against Imran Khans government, however, our leader went out to people as he lived in the hearts of people, he said.On the occasion, a former federal minister and senior PTI leader Ali Zaidi called the ruling coalitions boycott a perfect case of high treason.If the entire sitting government is boycotting the Supreme Court, it is completely a high-treason. What else is this?Ali Zaidi further added that a bunch of bandits are ruling the country and this is the first time that the government is boycotting the judiciary."

    "data": "Pakistan logged 371 fresh cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours amid a slight countrywide drop in the positivity ratio, the National Institute of Health, Islamabad (NIH) data showed Tuesday morning.As per the latest stats, the new infections were detected after diagnostic testing on 13,439 samples by the national COVID regulating body.After the new additions, Pakistan's COVID-19 case count rose to 1,551,251.However, the country's coronavirus positivity rate dropped to 2.76% within a single day after touching 3%.Meanwhile, Pakistan reported another coronavirus death during the last 24 hours, while 184 others were being treated in critical care units.BA5, part of the Omicron family, is the latest coronavirus variant to cause widespread waves of infection globally.According to the World Health Organisations most recent report, it was behind 52% of cases sequenced in late June, up from 37% in one week. In the United States, it is estimated to be causing around 65% of infections.Rising case numbersBA5 is not new. First identified in January, it has been tracked by the WHO since April.It is a sister variant of the Omicron strain that has been dominant worldwide since the end of 2021 and has already caused spikes in case rates  even with reduced testing  in countries including South Africa, where it was first found, as well as the United Kingdom, parts of Europe, and Australia.Coronavirus cases worldwide have now been rising for four weeks in a row, WHO data showed.Why is it spreading?Like its closely related sibling, BA4, BA5 is particularly good at evading the immune protection afforded either by vaccination or prior infection.For this reason, BA5 has a growth advantage over the other sublineages of Omicron that are circulating, Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHOs technical lead on COVID-19, told a news briefing on Tuesday.For many people, this means that they are getting re-infected, often even a short time after having COVID-19. Van Kerkhove said the WHO is assessing reports of re-infections.We have ample evidence that people whove been infected with Omicron are getting infected with BA5. No question about it, said Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota."

    "data": "Two Pakistan International Airlines planes flying on the same route avoided a mid-air collision in Iranian airspace on Sunday.Both the Pakistani flag carriers were at the same altitude near the United Arab Emirates (UAE) border when they witnessed an extraordinary situation that could have resulted in a major air accident due to the alleged negligence of the Iranian air traffic control (ATC), Daily Dawn reported.The ATC reportedly cleared the altitude for two airliners to fly at the same time.The publication cited sources as saying that a PIA Boeing 777 was en route Dubai from Islamabad while the other, Airbus A320, was flying from Doha to Peshawar, with Captain Athar Haroon and Captain Samiullah in the driving seat.As the two planes came dangerously close to each other, one was directed to dive while the other was asked to go higher in altitude as per standard practice followed in such situations.As per the news article, there is a system on all planes, called Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), which automatically guides the plane through communication with the TCAS of other aircrafts present nearby.PIA is writing to the Iranian air traffic control (ATC) to investigate as the Iranian ATC instructed the plane, but it was wrong, the publication quoted a PIA spokesman as saying.Giving details, the spokesperson said that PIA flight PK-211, a Boeing 777 from Islamabad to Dubai, was maintaining 35,000-foot altitude when it came close to Peshawar-bound flight PK-268 of Airbus A320 from Doha.PK-268 flight was flying at an altitude of 36,000 feet and was cleared to descend to 20,000 feet, he said, adding that the descent would have come in the flight path of PIA flight of Boeing 777 PK-211, the spokesman added.Meanwhile, the aircrafts TCAS corrected the course for both the planes and automatically guided them, the spokesperson added."

    "data": "FRANKFURT: All things to all people, the US dollar leaves its imprint in every corner of the global economy: It is the currency in which vital raw materials are bought and sold, and it is the safe haven to which investors turn in times of trouble.The greenback is now at a 20-year high against other world currencies, thanks in part to expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase its interest rates faster than most.Here are 10 reasons why you should be paying attention:A strong dollar is great if you are a US tourist. Hotels, meals or a designer bag all are cheaper by comparison, whether in London, the French Riviera or Cancun. It goes without saying that the reverse is true for the traveller going to the United States  unless they bought their Disneyland tickets or Las Vegas junket a good while ago, it is going to cost more.This is a welcome added boon for Americans travelling to one of the 19 countries that use the euro and a small consolation for European tourists in the United States. No more mental arithmetic is required to convert between dollars and euros  you can call it pretty much one for one now.For shoppers around the world in search of top US brands, the strong dollar means they could end up paying a premium for them unless local distributors try to cushion the currency impact. Just in the past days, US companies such as Mattel Inc  maker of the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels cars  said it was seeing a hit from the dollars move upwards, even if consumers as a whole looked ready to take on higher prices. For consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble  maker of everyday products such as Pampers or Ariel  the dollar's rise has always tended to have a similar impact on its sales. For Argentines, the rise of the dollar against the peso has meant a doubling of local prices in just one year and a spiralling economic crisis. Governments and businesses in a lot of emerging economies finance themselves by issuing bonds in US dollars. The amount they owe has now surged in value when measured in their local currency. Tapping the market for more credit has also become more expensive because US rates have risen.Countries like Turkey and Egypt that import a lot of their raw materials have been hit by a double whammy. Most commodities from oil to wheat are priced in US dollars, meaning they are paying more in their local currency for every barrel or bushel they buy. This comes as the price of many of those materials is already at a multi-year high due to the war in Ukraine, extreme weather and the aftershock of the COVID pandemic.A strong dollar is good news for people in poorer countries such as Mexico and Guatemala who depend on money sent by relatives who work in the United States. The COVID-19 fallout dealt a sharp blow to these remittances in 2020 but they've seen a steady recovery since.Even for richer countries such as Germany a strong dollar can spell trouble because it helps fuel already record-high inflation through more expensive imports. Local central banks have generally responded by raising interest rates, which makes credit dearer and slows economic growth.The Russian rouble is the only currency in the world that is comfortably in the black against the dollar this year  an unexpected outcome for a country under international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. But this strength  a somewhat artificial result of controls on foreign exchange  does little for the ordinary Russian. Moscow may be raking in tens of billions of dollars every month from its energy sales to the West, but Russian households still can't withdraw their foreign-currency savings. And Many Western brands from Adidas to H&M and Ikea have stopped selling in Russia since the war started.Marketed as the ultimate shield against inflation, the world's largest crypto currency hasn't lived up to its promise and is down by more than half this year despite runaway consumer prices in large parts of the world. Legions of individual investors drawn to crypto during last year's bull market have now ditched the digital tokens to park their savings in a US currency they perceive as safer  and which is now starting to pay interest again.If the price of a hamburger is anything to go by, the dollar might actually be too strong and bound to fall back. The Economist's Big Mac Index, which compares the price of the ubiquitous burger around the world, shows that the greenback is overvalued against all but a handful of currencies. The dollar is the most expensive  and a Big Mac cheapest for a US traveller  in Venezuela, Romania and Indonesia. The opposite is true in Switzerland, Norway and Uruguay."
